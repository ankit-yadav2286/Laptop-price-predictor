# Laptop-price-Range-Prediction

Created a laptop price predictor model with user interface based on the Features and specifications of the Laptop.

Performed Univariate analysis on all columns,feature Engineering on relevant columns with the help of statistical concepts 
and used the correlation matrix to identify the best performinmg features.

Experimented with Linear Regression,Ridge Regression,lasso regression,KNN,Decision Tree,SVM,Random Forest,Boosting and stacking algorithms
and got the R2 score of 90% approx with the Stacking on test data.

For user interface used streamlit.

This model will assist new Laptop companies in understanding the market and reducing the features and reducing the 
cost of unnecessary features/specifications in Laptop.
